# Nukes and Neurons

Nukes and Neurons is a first-person shooter split-screen game. Your only weapons are a variety of exploding projectiles against human or AI opponents. Users fight in one of three fully destructable voxel worlds. The AI is trained using imitation learning using a neural network to behave similarly to human players in the same situations. Unlike traditional AI, the imitation learning AI is given no domain knowledge about movement, path finding, game controls, gameplay, or objectives, and learns exclusively from observing human players in various situations. Other features include full controller support for local gameplay (Logitech Gamepad by default), several maps, and configurable learning parameters for the AI.
